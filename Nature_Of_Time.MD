# The Eternal Now: Exploring the Nature of Time
## From Time Wave Zero to the Fractal Nature of Reality

## Introduction
Time is such an interesting topic actually. I remember as a kid I thought that there's nothing more boring than thinking about time. Newton misled me with his theory of the perfectly flat timeline flow. And there are so many different possible ways to think about time.

- **Time is the present moment. Eternal now. Time is zero.**
- **In geometry, that's the point, without dimension.**
- **Reality is made of time, not in time.**

## Newtonian Time

- In Newtonian physics, time is considered absolute and uniform across all observers. This means that the passage of time is the same everywhere, regardless of motion or gravitational fields. This view can seem simplistic and perhaps even misleading when compared to more modern theories.

## Time as the Present Moment

- The concept of "time as the present moment" aligns with the idea of the "eternal now." This perspective suggests that only the present moment truly exists, and the past and future are merely constructs of our minds. This view is often associated with certain philosophical and spiritual traditions, which emphasize living in the present and the impermanence of all things.

## Time as Zero: The Point Without Dimension

### Geometric Analogy
- In geometry, a point is a location with no dimensions. It has no length, width, or height. Similarly, if we consider time as a point, it represents a single, indivisible instant. This instant is the present moment, the "now."

### Eternal Now
- The concept of the eternal now suggests that only the present moment truly exists. The past and future are mental constructs, memories, and projections, respectively. This idea is often found in various spiritual and philosophical traditions, such as Zen Buddhism, where the emphasis is on living in the present moment.

## Reality Made of Time, Not in Time

### Change and Reality
- If time is a point without dimension, then the change we perceive in reality must be happening within this eternal now. This implies that what we experience as the passage of time is actually a series of changes occurring in the present moment. Reality is not moving through time; rather, it is constantly transforming within the context of the eternal now.

### Time as the Only Infinity
- The idea that time is the only true infinity suggests that the present moment, while seemingly fleeting, is actually infinite in its depth and potential. Every moment contains the entirety of the Universe's possibilities and is a point of infinite potential for change and transformation.

## Time Wave Zero (TWZ)

### Overview
- **Time Wave Zero (TWZ)**, developed by Terence McKenna, is a model that proposes a fractal pattern in the structure of time. According to McKenna, the Universe is structured in a way that historical events resonate with the present moment, creating a complex, interconnected web of time.

### Morphogenetic Field of the Present Moment
- The concept of a **morphogenetic field** suggests that the present moment is influenced by and resonates with historical events. This idea, proposed by biologist Rupert Sheldrake, posits that past events and collective experiences shape the present and future. In the context of TWZ, the present moment is not isolated but is part of a larger, interconnected system where the past and future are in constant communication.

### Time as Manifold
- The idea of time as a manifold suggests that time is not a simple linear progression but a complex, multidimensional structure. Each point in time is connected to other points in a non-linear fashion, creating a web of interconnected moments. This aligns with the idea that the present moment is a point of infinite potential, where the past and future are in resonance.

## Fractal Nature of Reality

### Multi-Central Reality
- **Nikola Tesla** proposed that reality is multi-central, meaning that it does not have a single center or endpoint. This idea aligns with the concept of a fractal Universe, where patterns repeat at different scales. In a multi-central reality, every point can be a center, and the structure of the Universe is self-similar at various levels.

### Fractal Patterns
- Fractals are mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern at every scale. This self-similarity is a key feature of fractal geometry and can be observed in natural phenomena such as coastlines, snowflakes, and the branching of trees. The fractal nature of reality suggests that the same patterns and principles govern the microcosm and the macrocosm.

### Reality as a Fractal Web
- If reality is fractal, then the present moment is not just a point but a node in a vast, interconnected web. Each node (or present moment) is connected to other nodes, forming a complex, self-similar structure. This perspective aligns with the idea of the morphogenetic field and the Time Wave Zero model, where the present moment is influenced by and resonates with historical events.

## Philosophical and Scientific Implications

### Philosophical Perspectives
- **Heraclitus**: His idea that everything flows and nothing remains the same aligns with the concept of constant change within the eternal now. The river of change is always flowing, but it is the present moment that captures this flow.
- **Buddhism**: The concept of impermanence (anicca) in Buddhism emphasizes that all phenomena are in a state of constant flux. This aligns with the idea that reality is always changing within the eternal now.
- **Terence McKenna**: McKenna's TWZ model suggests that the present moment is influenced by a fractal pattern of historical events, creating a complex, interconnected web of time.
- **Nikola Tesla**: Tesla's idea of a multi-central reality and the fractal nature of the Universe suggests that the structure of reality is self-similar at different scales, with each point potentially being a center.

### Scientific Perspectives
- **Quantum Mechanics**: In quantum mechanics, the concept of superposition suggests that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. This can be seen as a reflection of the infinite potential of the present moment.
- **Fractal Geometry**: Fractal geometry provides a mathematical framework for understanding the self-similar patterns in nature and the Universe, supporting the idea of a fractal reality.

## Integrating the Ideas

### Eternal Now and Change
- If time is a point without dimension, then the change we observe is a result of the dynamic nature of reality within this eternal now. Each moment is a new configuration of the Universe, and the illusion of time passing is a product of our perception of these changes.

### Infinite Potential and Resonance
- The eternal now can be seen as a point of infinite potential. Every moment contains the seeds of all possible futures, and the present is where these potentials are realized. The morphogenetic field of the present moment, influenced by historical events, adds a layer of complexity and interconnectedness to this view.

### Fractal Web of Reality
- The concept of a fractal web of reality suggests that the present moment is not isolated but is part of a larger, interconnected system. This aligns with the idea that the present moment is a point of infinite potential, where the past and future are in resonance. The multi-central nature of reality, as proposed by Tesla, further enriches this perspective by suggesting that the structure of the Universe is self-similar at different scales, with each point potentially being a center.

## Conclusion

Perspective on time as a point without dimension and reality as something that changes within the eternal now offers a deep and holistic view of the Universe. The addition of the Time Wave Zero (TWZ) model, the concept of the morphogenetic field, and the fractal nature of reality further enriches this perspective. These ideas suggest that the present moment is influenced by and resonates with historical events, creating a complex, interconnected web of time. This view not only resonates with philosophical and spiritual traditions but also has intriguing connections to modern scientific theories. By embracing the eternal now and the fractal nature of reality, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the dynamic and interconnected nature of the Universe.
